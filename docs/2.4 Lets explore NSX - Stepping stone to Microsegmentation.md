Challenge 2.4
"Lets explore NSX - Stepping stone to Microsegmentation"
---

# Introduction

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

1. Configure a Distributed Firewall using NSX-T

As a part of this challenge you are also expected to <u>log on to the AVS Private cloud assigned to your team</u> achieve a phased approach enabling yourself to quickly implement zone-based segmentation – for example between Application1 and Application2 – and then gradually you can deepen your security with application isolation and micro-segmentation over time.

## Use Case Tip 

Using the NSX Service-defined firewall, customers can gain visibility into traffic and easily create network segmentation by defining them entirely in software — no need to change your network or hairpin traffic by deploying discrete appliances. 

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. 

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server and the NSX Manager.

Applications and workloads running in an Azure VMware Solution private cloud environment require name resolution and DHCP services (optionally) for lookup and IP address assignments. A proper DHCP and DNS infrastructure are required to provide these services. You can configure a virtual machine to provide these services in your private cloud environment.

## Create a Distributed firewall

Ensure the following predeployed VMs are already deployed within the AVS vCenter server 

mhack-win11-DFW1
&
mhack-win11-DFW2

1.	From your browser, log in with admin privileges to an NSX Manager at https://nsx-manager-ip-address.

2.	Go to Inventory > Groups > Add Group 
 
3.	Add a group name as Application1 and then press Set Members

4.	Add the IP of mhack-win11-DFW1  VM IP to this group and the press apply

![](/Images/NSX/NSX_image11.png)
 
5.	Then press save button

6.	Now create a second Application group and click set members

7.	Click the IP addresses and then provide the IP address of the AVS mhack-win11-DFW2 VM and then press apply

![](/Images/NSX/NSX_image14.png)
 
8.	Select Security > Distributed Firewall from the navigation panel.

9.	Click Add Policy

10.	Enter a Name for the new policy section.

11.	Click Add Rule
 
![](/Images/NSX/NSX_image17.png)

12.	Set source for the rule by selecting the first Application group and then press apply

![](/Images/NSX/NSX_image18.png)
 
13.	Set destination for the rule by selecting the first Application group and then press apply

![](/Images/NSX/NSX_image19.png)
 
14.	Keep the action as Allow and then press publish

![](/Images/NSX/NSX_image20.png)

15.	One you firewall rule has been published, ping the mhack-win11-DFW2 VM from mhack-win11-DFW1 VM. We should notice that the ping is going through

16.	Now come back to the distributed firewall and set the action to reject

17.	Now ping the mhack-win11-DFW2 VM from mhack-win11-DFW1 VM. We should notice that the ping is blocked

This proves the distributed firewall rule between the 2 application groups

This concludes the Microsegmentation stepping stone for AVS!!
