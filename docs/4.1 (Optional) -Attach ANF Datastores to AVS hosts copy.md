# Introduction

Azure NetApp Files is an enterprise-class, high-performance, metered file storage service. The service supports the most demanding enterprise file-workloads in the cloud: databases, SAP, and high-performance computing applications, with no code changes. For more information on Azure NetApp Files, see Azure NetApp Files documentation.

Azure VMware Solution supports attaching Network File System (NFS) datastores as a persistent storage option. You can create NFS datastores with Azure NetApp Files volumes and attach them to clusters of your choice. You can also create virtual machines (VMs) for optimal cost and performance.

By using NFS datastores backed by Azure NetApp Files, you can expand your storage instead of scaling the clusters. You can also use Azure NetApp Files volumes to replicate data from on-premises or primary VMware environments for the secondary site.

Create your Azure VMware Solution and create Azure NetApp Files NFS volumes in the virtual network connected to it using an ExpressRoute. Ensure there's connectivity from the private cloud to the NFS volumes created. Use those volumes to create NFS datastores and attach the datastores to clusters of your choice in a private cloud. As a native integration, no other permissions configured via vSphere are needed.

The following diagram demonstrates a typical architecture of Azure NetApp Files backed NFS datastores attached to an Azure VMware Solution private cloud via ExpressRoute.

<details>

## Register the Microsoft.NetApp Resource Provider with your Azure subscription. (Already Done)

Enable specific Azure region within your Azure subscription for being able to create NetApp Account by raising a specific type of support incident as below. (Already Done) 

Issue Type: Service and subscription limits (quotas) 

Quota Type: Storage: Azure NetApp Files limits 

Request Details 

Quota Type: Region Access 

Region Requested: <YOUR FAVOURITE AZURE REGION THAT SUPPORTS ANF> 

Identify the VNet which hosts the ER Gateway used for terminating AVS D-MSEE circuit from Workshop Pre-requisites section (Mhack00X-vnet). Create a delegated subnet in this VNet. This subnet should be delegated to service Microsoft.Netapp/volumes. (Already Done) 

## Verify ANF Delegated Subnet (Already Done)

Identify the VNet assigned to your AVS SDDC. This is available from Workshop Pre-requisites section. 

Navigate to the subnets under that VNet and ensure that ANFSubnet exists.

Ensure that ANFSubnet has subnet delegation configured for Microsoft.Netapp/volumes.  
 
This step should already be done, If it is not configured, configure subnet delegation for Microsoft.Netapp/volumes as shown below

## Verify ANF Account (Already Done)

Identify the ANF Account that has already been provisioned, you should see a resource group called MhackANF, with an ANF Account called MhackANF 

![](/Images\ANF\Picture3.png)

## Verify ANF Capacity Pool (Already Done)

Navigate to ANF Account identified/created in Step 3. 

Select "Capacity pools" from the left hand side menu. 

Ensure that LEVELUP-ANF-CP is listed as capacity pool. It should have "Premium" as service level, 4TB as Size and QoS type of Auto.

## Create ANF Volume (Already Done)
 
Creation of first volume takes around 5 minutes. Subsequent creation of volumes is quicker (< 1 mins) 

Select the Capacity Pool identified in Step 4. 

Select "Volumes" option from left hand side menu. 

On the right hand side pane, click "Add volume" button. 

On the "Basics" tab, provide - 

Name your volume

Select the VNet assigned to your group

Select the delegated subnet called ANFSubnet 

Select "Standard" as networking features

![](/Images\ANF\Picture5.png)

On the "Protocol" tab, provide – 

File path: Name of the volume. 

Azure VMware Solution Datastore: Checked 

Keep default options for rest of the fields.

Click "Review + create" button

## Connect AVS with ANF Volume

Navigate to AVS SDDC assigned to your group. This is documented at Workshop Pre-requisites section. 

Click "Storage (preview)" option from the left-hand menu. 

Click "Connect Azure NetApp Files Volume"

![](/Images\ANF\Picture7.png)

On the flyout menu that appears, provide - 

Azure subscription, ANF Account, Capacity Pool and Volume you created in Step 5.  

AVS SDDC cluster 

Datastore name which is recommended to be same as volume name. 

![](/Images\ANF\Picture8.png)

Click "Connect"

## Verify the ANF volume as a datastore in AVS

Connect to AVS SDDC vCenter assigned to your group via jumpbox. This is documented at Workshop Pre-requisites section. 

Click on "Storage" menu on the vCenter portal. ANF Volume should appear as part of the datastores under SDDC. 

Verify the size of volume set up appears correctly on AVS SDDC vCenter. 

This concludes the attachment of Azure NetApp Files volume into AVS!!
