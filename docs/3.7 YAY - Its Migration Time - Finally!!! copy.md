7.	Once the VM is migrated into AVS, check the IP address of the VM. 

Note : 

As the VM that was migrated was on a extended network, the IP address of the VM has not changed; however if the VM that was migrated was not on an extended network, then the IP address of the VM would have changed.

This concludes the VM Migration into AVS!!
