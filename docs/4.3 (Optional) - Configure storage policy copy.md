4.3 (Optional) - "Configure storage policy"

# Introduction

VMware vSAN storage policies define storage requirements for your virtual machines (VMs). These policies guarantee the required level of service for your VMs because they determine how storage is allocated to the VM. Each VM deployed to a vSAN datastore is assigned at least one VM storage policy.

You can assign a VM storage policy in an initial deployment of a VM or when you do other VM operations, such as cloning or migrating. Post-deployment cloudadmin users or equivalent roles can't change the default storage policy for a VM. However, VM storage policy per disk changes is permitted.

The Run command lets authorized users change the default or existing VM storage policy to an available policy for a VM post-deployment. There are no changes made on the disk-level VM storage policy. You can always change the disk level VM storage policy as per your requirements.

## List storage policies
You'll run the Get-StoragePolicy cmdlet to list the vSAN based storage policies available to set on a VM.

Sign in to the Azure portal.

Select Run command > Packages > Get-StoragePolicies.

Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select Run.

## Set storage policy on VM

You'll run the Set-VMStoragePolicy cmdlet to modify vSAN-based storage policies on a default cluster, individual VM, or group of VMs sharing a similar VM name. For example, if you have three VMs named "MyVM1", "MyVM2", and "MyVM3", supplying "MyVM*" to the VMName parameter would change the StoragePolicy on all three VMs.

Select Run command > Packages > Set-VMStoragePolicy.

Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select Run.

## Set storage policy on all VMs in a location

You'll run the Set-LocationStoragePolicy cmdlet to Modify vSAN based storage policies on all VMs in a location where a location is the name of a cluster, resource pool, or folder. For example, if you have 3 VMs in Cluster-3, supplying "Cluster-3" would change the storage policy on all 3 VMs.

Select Run command > Packages > Set-LocationStoragePolicy.

Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select Run.

Check Notifications to see the progress.

## Specify storage policy for a cluster

You'll run the Set-ClusterDefaultStoragePolicy cmdlet to specify default storage policy for a cluster,

Select Run command > Packages > Set-ClusterDefaultStoragePolicy.

Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select Run.
