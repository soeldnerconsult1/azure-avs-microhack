Challenge 3.1
"Prepare the On Prem environment - Configure HCX Appliance"
---

# Introduction

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

1.	Configure HCX Manager Appliance On-Prem

As a part of this challenge you are also expected to <u>log on to the On Prem and AVS vCenter servers from the jumpbox assigned to your user</u>. You will also be expected to log on to the AVS portal to retrieve the HCX activation key for On-Prem HCX appliance.

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. Incorrectly deploying the HCX may result in multiple forthcoming steps not operating as expected.

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server.

### Note

The HCX Manager VM within the On Prem vCenter server was deployed through an OVA (appliance) that we downloaded from AVS HCX. This step was done during the environment preparation to save time.

You can ask your coach to show you how this step was done

## Use Cases for HCX

1. Customer migration is often driven by a need to move a known set of existing applications to a new infrastructure. The most common use case for HCX is migration from On-Prem to Azure VMware Service (AVS).
2. Customer wants to realize value faster for new AVS environments while driving down operational costs.
3. Due to time constraint choosing HCX proves to be beneficial as parallel migration scenarions like bulk migrations as well as live non-disruptive migrations to and from On-Prem to AVS.

## Configure HCX Manager Appliance On-Prem

1.	Log in to the On Prem SDDC by login to your Azure jumpbox and by navigating to portal.azure.com. Log on to the jumpbox using the Bastian host and key in the username and password provided  within the AVS "Credentials&IP" document identified for your team

2.	Log on to your On-Prem vCenter using the "Credentials&IP" document

3.	Confirm that the vCenter server has hcx-manager deployed and powered on.

4.	Log on to the AVS private Cloud for your team in Azure Portal from where you will need to get a activation key for the HCX manager On-Prem

5.	In the Azure VMware Solution portal, go to Manage > Add-ons > Migration using HCX > Connect with on-premise using HCX keys > Add > , specify the HCX Key Name (example as shown in the screenshot), and then select Add.

6.	Use the admin credentials to sign in to the on-premises VMware HCX Manager at https://HCXManagerIP:9443. Use the "Credentials&IP" doc for this

### TIP
The admin user password is set during the VMware HCX Manager OVA file deployment.

7.	In Licensing, enter your key for HCX Advanced Key and select Activate.

### Important TIP
VMware HCX Manager must have open internet access or a proxy configured.

8.	In Datacentre Location, specify Chicago, Unted States of America and press continue

11.	In Connect your vCenter, provide the FQDN or IP address of your vCenter server and the appropriate credentials, and then select Continue. Use the "Credentials&IP" document for this

12. In Configure SSO/PSC, provide the FQDN or IP address of your Platform Services Controller (PSC), and then select Continue. In this case the the PSC is the same as the On-Prem vCenter server. Use the "Credentials&IP" document for the same

13. Verify that the information entered is correct and select Restart.

### Note
You'll experience a delay after restarting before being prompted for the next step.

After the services restart, you'll see vCenter showing as green on the screen that appears. Both vCenter and SSO must have the appropriate configuration parameters, which should be the same as the previous screen.

14.	Once HCX Appliance is restarted, log on to the HCX Manager UI â€“ https://hcxmanagerIP:9443

15.	Go to Configuration -> vSphere Role Mapping -> replace System Administrator and Enterprise Administrator user groups with the following custom domain (instead of vsphere.local). 

Replace the domain name according to the group you have been assigned- microhack-one.zpod.io, Microhack-two.zpod.io or Microhack-three.zpod.io
