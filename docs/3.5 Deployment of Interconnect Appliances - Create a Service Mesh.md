Challenge 3.5
"Deployment of Interconnect Appliances? Create a Service Mesh"
---

# Introduction

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

1.	Deploy a Service Mesh

As a part of this challenge you are also expected to <u>log on to the On Prem vCenter server and HCX Manager plugin in the On-Prem vCenter</u> to deploy the interconnect and network extension appliances as a part of Service Mesh

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. Incorrectly deploying the HCX may result in multiple forthcoming steps not operating as expected.

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server.

## What is a Service Mesh? 

When HCX Migration, Disaster recovery, Network Extension, and WAN Optimization services are activated, HCX deploys Virtual Appliances in the source site and corresponding "peer" virtual appliances on the destination site. The Multi-Site Service Mesh activates the configuration, deployment, and serviceability of these Interconnect virtual appliance pairs.

## Create a Service Mesh

Now it's time to configure a service mesh between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

### Note
To successfully establish a service mesh with Azure VMware Solution:
Ports UDP 500/4500 are open between your on-premises VMware HCX Connector 'uplink' network profile addresses and the Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud 'uplink' network profile addresses.
Be sure to review the VMware HCX required ports.

1.	Under Infrastructure, select Interconnect > Service Mesh > Create Service Mesh.

2.	Review the sites that are pre-populated, and then select Continue.

### Note
If this is your first service mesh configuration, you won't need to modify this screen

3.	Select the source and remote compute profiles from the drop-down lists, and then select Continue.

The selections define the resources where VMs can consume VMware HCX services.

### Note
Uplink network profiles connect to the network through which the remote site's interconnect appliances can be reached

6.	In Advanced Configuration - Network Extension Appliance Scale Out, review and select Continue.

### Note 
You can have up to eight VLANs per appliance, but you can deploy another appliance to add another eight VLANs. You must also have IP space to account for the more appliances, and it's one IP per appliance. For more information, see VMware HCX Configuration Limits.

7. In Advanced Configuration - Traffic Engineering, do not select the Application Path Resiliency and Traffic Flow Conditioning, and then select Continue.

10.	Select View Tasks to monitor the deployment.
 
When the service mesh deployment finishes successfully, you'll see the services as green.

11.	Verify the service mesh's health by checking the appliance status.
