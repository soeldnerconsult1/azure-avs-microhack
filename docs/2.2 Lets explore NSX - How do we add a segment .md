Challenge 2.2
"Lets explore NSX - How do we add a segment? "
---

# Introduction

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

1.	Add a Network Segment
2.	Attach a Virtual Machine to the Network Segment

As a part of this challenge you are also expected to <u>log on to the jump server assigned to your user</u> and create a network segment from NSX and then a DHCP range will be defined within that segment. When a  virtual machine will be connected to that segment they VM will automatically obtain the IP from the DHCP range.  

### Note

An AVS segment can be created both in the NSX portal and AVS portal

## Use Case Tip 

VMs within the AVS environment can be easily segmented into multiple subnets etc. without the need for physical routers and switches

Customers can easily achieve data center segmentation with a few simple steps without changing any of the underlying physical network configurations with VMware NSX and vSphere 

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. 

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server and the NSX Manager.

## Add a Network Segment
1.	In NSX-T Manager, select Networking > Segments, and then select Add Segment.

2.	Enter a name for the segment.

3.	Select the Tier-1 Gateway (TNTxx-T1) as the Connected Gateway 

4.	Select the pre-configured overlay Transport Zone (TNTxx-OVERLAY-TZ) and then select Set Subnets in gateway/prefix length format.

5. Add DHCP range to your segment such that the VM's attached to this segment can recieve IP address dynamically

6.	Select Apply and then Save.

### Note
The IP address needs to be on a non-overlapping RFC1918 address block, which ensures connection to the VMs on the new segment.

7. Once the segment is created  refer to the “Credentials&IP” document to attach the respective virtual machine listed there to the new segment that has been created and verify that the virtual machine is getting an IP from the DHCP

### Hint

The segment needs to attach to the virtual machine by right clicking the VM > Edit Settings > Network Adaptor 1

This concludes the NSX segment configuration for AVS!!
